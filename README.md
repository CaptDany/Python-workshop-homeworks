<!-- DOCUMENTATION -->
## What is this?


You will find the homework posted for the [Python](https://www.python.org/) workshop as well as the instructions for each one of them in each folder.

I recommend using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) or [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) to edit and work with the files provided.

Iâ€™ll be posting in this repo whatever homework is uploaded to the classroom.

## Getting Started

You can basically **download the whole repo** in order to work on the files, or in an easier fashion, work directly in a fork of your own within **GitHub**.

I would very much appreciate feedback and collaboration, as it encourages everyone to learn and work. You can download and copy directly, as well, but I would definetly recommend **not to do that**, as it not only makes for lazier developers, but it defeats the whole purpose of the workshop.

However, stealing is pirate's game, that's what pirates do. So do as you please.
## Why am I doing this?

Because I **can** and I **want to**.
I believe that spreading knowledge and taking feedback is the way to go.
I also believe it can save time and effort to everybody.
Contribution is very welcome.
