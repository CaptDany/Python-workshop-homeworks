This are the evidences for the month of January.
They include:

EVIDENCE 1: Print and mathematical operators

Take capture of the code and to the console of the following algorithms


1.-Print in console by presenting yourself and adding your name in a variable

        Example: Hello my name is "x"


2.-Print the sum of the double of two variables in the console
3.-Print half of two multiplying variables on the console
4.-Print on the console the multiplication of one variable by half of the other

Use these values for the exercise variables
        x = 15
        y = 10

Remember that you can use parentheses as if it were a calculator
        Example: (2*x) * (y/2)

They can do everything in the same Python file and still send a single capture.

EVIDENCE 2: Inputs and conditionals

Take code capture and console the following algorithms.

1.-Print the greater of two numbers given by the user on the console

2.-Make a basic calculator, where we can select if we want to get:
        -Area of a triangle (ask for base and height)
        -Area of a circle (ask for radius)
        -Area of a square (ask for side)

The value of the data they will put in the exercises will be up to your liking.
